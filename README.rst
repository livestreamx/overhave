Overview
--------

Web-interface
-------------

The web-interface is a basic tool for BDD features management. It consists of:

* `Info` - index page with optional information about your tool or project;
* `Scenarios` - section for features management, contains subsections
    `Features`, `Test runs`, `Versions` and `Tags`:

    * `Features`
        gives an interface for features records management and provides info
        about id, name author, time, editor and publishing status; it is possible
        to search, edit or delete items through Script panel.

        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/label_img.png
          :width: 500
          :align: center
          :alt: Features list

    * `Test runs`
        gives an interface for test runs management and provides info about.

        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/test_runs_img.png
          :width: 500
          :align: center
          :alt: Test runs list

    * Versions
        contains feature versions in corresponding to test runs; versions contains PR-links to
        the remote Git repository.

        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/versions_img.png
          :width: 500
          :align: center
          :alt: Feature published versions list

    * Tags
        contains tags values, which are used for feature's tagging.

        .. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/tags_img.png
          :width: 500
          :align: center
          :alt: Feature published versions list

* `Test users` - section for viewing and configuring test users;
* `Access` - section for access management, contains `Users` and
    `Groups` subsections;
* `Emulation` - experimental section for alternative tools implementation
    (in development).

**Overhave** features could be created and/or edited through special
*script panel* in feature edit mode. Feature should have type registered by the
application, unique name, specified tasks list with the traditional format
```PRJ-NUMBER``` and scenario text.

**Script panel** has `pytest-bdd`_ steps table on the right side of interface.
These steps should be defined in appropriate fixture modules and registered
at the application on start-up to be displayed.

  Example of **Overhave** script panel in feature edit mode

Allure report
-------------

**Overhave** generates `Allure`_ report after tests execution in web-interface.
If you execute tests manually through `PyTest`_, these results are could be
converted into the `Allure`_ report also with the `Allure CLI`_ tool.
This report contains scenarios descriptions as they are described in features.

  :align: center
  :alt: Allure test-case report

  Example of generated `Allure`_ report after execution of **Overhave**'s feature

Demo-mode (Quickstart)
----------------------

**Overhave** has special demo-mode (in development), which could be possibly
used for framework demonstration and manual debugging / testing. The framework
provides a CLI entrypoints for easy server run in debug mode:

.. code-block:: shell

    make up  # start PostgreSQL database and Redis
    overhave db create-all  # create Overhave database schema
    overhave-demo admin  # start Overhave admin on port 8076 in debug mode
    overhave-demo consumer -s test  # start Overhave test execution consumer

**Note**: you could run admin in special mode, which does not require
consumers. This mode uses *threadpool* for running testing and publication
tasks asynchronously:

.. code-block:: shell

    overhave-demo admin --threadpool --language=ru

But this *threadpool* mode is unscalable in *kubernetes* paradigm. So,
it's highly recommended to use corresponding consumers exactly.

Command-line interface
----------------------

**Overhave** has a CLI that provides a simple way to start service web-interface,
run consumer and execute basic database operations. Examples are below:

.. code-block:: shell

    overhave db create-all
    overhave admin --port 8080
    overhave consumer -s publication
    overhave api -p 8000 -w 4

**Note**: service start-up takes a set of settings, so you can set them through
virtual environment with prefix ```OVERHAVE_```, for example ```OVERHAVE_DB_URL```.
If you want to configure settings in more explicit way through context injection,
please see next part of docs.

Context injection
-----------------

Context setting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Service could be configured via application context injection with prepared
instance of `OverhaveContext` object. This context could be set using
```set_context``` function of initialized ```ProxyFactory``` instance.

For example, ```my_custom_context``` prepared. So, application start-up could
be realised with follow code:

.. code-block:: python

    from overhave import overhave_app, overhave_admin_factory

    factory = overhave_admin_factory()
    factory.set_context(my_custom_context)
    overhave_app(factory).run(host='localhost', port=8080, debug=True)

**Note**:

* ```overhave_app``` is the prepared `Flask` application with already enabled
    Flask Admin and Login Manager plug-ins;
* ```overhave_factory``` is a function for LRU cached instance of the **Overhave**
    factory ```ProxyFactory```; the instance has an access to application components,
    directly used in ```overhave_app```.
* ```my_custom_context``` is an example of context configuration, see an
    example code in `context_example.rst`_.

Redis
---------
* **RedisSentinel** - redis connection through sentinel. To enable sentinel connection use env OVERHAVE_REDIS_SENTINEL_ENABLED=True

* **Redis** - default redis connection without sentinel.

Consumers
---------

**Overhave** has `producer-consumer` architecture, based on Redis streams,
and supported 3 consumer's types:

* **TEST** - consumer for test execution with it's own factory
    ```overhave_test_execution_factory```;

* **PUBLICATION** - consumer for features publication with it's own factory
    ```overhave_publication_factory```;

* **EMULATION** - consumer for specific emulation with it's own factory
    ```overhave_emulation_factory```.

**Note**: the ```overhave_test_execution_factory``` has ability for context injection
and could be enriched with the custom context as the ```overhave_admin_factory```.

Project structure
-----------------

**Overhave** supports it's own special project structure:

.. image:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/project_structure.png
  :width: 300
  :alt: **Overhave** project structure

The right approach is to create a **root directory** (like "demo" inside the current
repository) that contains **features**, **fixtures** and **steps** directories.

The **Features** directory contains different feature types as
separate directories, each of them corresponds to predefined `pytest-bdd`_
set of steps.

The **Fixtures** directory contains typical `PyTest`_ modules splitted by different
feature types. These modules are used for `pytest-bdd`_ isolated test runs. It is
necessary because of special mechanism of `pytest-bdd`_ steps collection.

The **Steps** directory contains `pytest-bdd`_ steps packages splitted by differrent
feature types also. Each steps subdirectory has it's own declared steps in according
to supported feature type.

So, it is possible to create your own horizontal structure of
different product directions with unique steps and `PyTest`_ fixtures.

**Note**: this structure is used in **Overhave** application. The formed data
gives a possibility to specify registered feature type in the web-interface
*script panel*. Also, this structure defines which steps will be displayed in
the right side of *script panel*.

Feature format
--------------

**Overhave** has it's own special feature's text format, which inherits
Gherkin from `pytest-bdd`_ with unique updates:

* required tag that is related to existing feature type directory, where
    current feature is located;
* any amount of arbitrary tags;
* severity tag - implements `Allure`_ severity to feature or just tagged
    scenario (for example: ```@severity.blocker```);
* info about feature - who is creator, last editor and publisher;
* task tracker's tickets with format ```PRJ-1234```;

An example of filled feature content is located in
`feature_example.rst`_.

Pytest markers
--------------

**Overhave** implements solution for `PyTest`_ markers usage with custom
additional information:

* "`disabled`": same as `skip` marker, but it's necessary to setup reason;
* "`xfail`": traditional `xfail` with strict reason presence.

Examples:

.. code-block:: gherkin

    @disabled(not ready)
    Feature: My business feature

.. code-block:: gherkin

    @disabled(TODO: https://tracker.myorg.com/browse/PRJ-333; deadline 01.01.25)
    Scenario: Yet another business feature


.. code-block:: gherkin

    @xfail(bug: https://tracker.myorg.com/browse/PRJ-555)
    Scenario outline: Other business feature

If reason contains URL, so **Overhave** will attach `Allure` link to report:
for `disabled` - it will be `LinkType.LINK`, for `xfail` - `LinkType.ISSUE`.

Feature links
-------------

**Overhave** has ability to set links to it's own admin service in `Allure`_
test-cases. Link will be set automatically when you generate `Allure`_ report.
This function can be enabled via setup of environment variable
```OVERHAVE_ADMIN_URL```:

.. code-block:: bash

    export OVERHAVE_ADMIN_URL=https://overhave-admin.myorg.com

Also, **Overhave** has ability to set links to feature file in `Git`_ repository.
Link will be set automatically when you generate `Allure`_ report. This function
can be enabled via setup of environment variable
```OVERHAVE_GIT_PROJECT_URL```:

.. code-block:: bash

    export OVERHAVE_GIT_PROJECT_URL=https://git.myorg.com/bdd-features-repo


Language
--------

The web-interface language is ENG by default and could not be switched
(if it's necessary - please, create a ```feature request``` or contribute
yourself).

The feature text as well as `pytest-bdd`_ BDD keywords are configurable
with **Overhave** extra models, for example RUS keywords are already defined
in framework and available for usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from overhave.extra import RUSSIAN_PREFIXES

    language_settings = OverhaveLanguageSettings(step_prefixes=RUSSIAN_PREFIXES)

**Note**: you could create your own prefix-value mapping for your language:

.. code-block:: python

    from overhave import StepPrefixesModel

    GERMAN_PREFIXES = StepPrefixesModel(
        FEATURE="Merkmal:",
        SCENARIO_OUTLINE="Szenarioübersicht:",
        SCENARIO="Szenario:",
        BACKGROUND="Hintergrund:",
        EXAMPLES="Beispiele:",
        EXAMPLES_VERTICAL="Beispiele: Vertikal",
        GIVEN="Gegeben ",
        WHEN="Wann ",
        THEN="Dann ",
        AND="Und ",
        BUT="Aber ",
    )

Git integration
---------------

**Overhave** gives an ability to sent your new features or changes to
remote git repository, which is hosted by `Bitbucket`_ or `GitLab`_.
Integration with bitbucket is native, while integration with GitLab
uses `python-gitlab`_ library.

You are able to set necessary settings for your project:

.. code-block:: python

    publisher_settings = OverhaveGitlabPublisherSettings(
        repository_id='123',
        default_target_branch_name='master',
    )
    client_settings=OverhaveGitlabClientSettings(
        url="https://gitlab.mycompany.com",
        auth_token=os.environ.get("MY_GITLAB_AUTH_TOKEN"),
    )

The pull-request (for Bitbucket) or merge-request (for GitLab)
created when you click the button `Create pull request` on
test run result's page. This button is available only for `success`
test run's result.

**Note**: one of the most popular cases of GitLab API
authentication is the OAUTH2 schema with service account.
In according to this schema, you should have OAUTH2 token,
which is might have a short life-time and could not be
specified through environment. For this situation, **Overhave**
has special `TokenizerClient` with it's own
`TokenizerClientSettings` - this simple client could take
the token from a remote custom GitLab tokenizer service.

Git-to-DataBase synchronization
-------------------------------

**Overhave** gives an ability to synchronize your current `git`_
repository's state with database. It means that your features,
which are located on the database, could be updated - and the source
of updates is your repository.

**For example**: you had to do bulk data replacement in `git`_
repository, and now you want to deliver changes to remote database.
This not so easy matter could be solved with **Overhave** special
tooling:

You are able to set necessary settings for your project:

.. code-block:: bash

    overhave sync run  # only update existing features
    overhave sync run --create-db-features  # update + create new features
    overhave sync run --pull-repository  # pull git repo and run sync

You are able to test this tool with **Overhave** demo mode.
By default, 3 features are created in demo database. Just try
to change them or create new features and run synchronization
command - you will get the result.

.. code-block:: bash

    overhave-demo sync-run  # or with '--create-db-features'

**Overhave** supports validation of existing feature files.
Command try to parse features and fill defined feature info format.
If there is any problem, special error will be thrown.

.. code-block:: bash

    overhave sync validate-features
    overhave sync validate-features --raise-if-nullable-id
    overhave sync validate-features --pull-repository

And yes, your are able to try it with demo mode:

.. code-block:: bash

    overhave-demo validate-features
    overhave sync validate-features -r  # --raise-if-nullable-id

Custom index
------------

**Overhave** gives an ability to set custom index.html file for rendering. Path
to file could be set through environment as well as set with context:

.. code-block:: python

    admin_settings = OverhaveAdminSettings(
        index_template_path="/path/to/index.html"
    )

Authorization strategy
----------------------

**Overhave** provides several authorization strategies, declared by
```AuthorizationStrategy``` enum:

* `Simple` - strategy without real authorization.
    Each user could use preferred name. This name will be used for user
    authority. Each user is unique. Password not required.

* `Default` - strategy with real authorization.
    Each user could use only registered credentials.

* `LDAP` - strategy with authorization using remote LDAP server.
    Each user should use his LDAP credentials. LDAP
    server returns user groups. If user in default 'admin' group or his groups
    list contains admin group - user will be authorized. If user already placed
    in database - user will be authorized too. No one password stores.

Appropriate strategy and additional data should be placed into
```OverhaveAuthorizationSettings```, for example LDAP strategy could be
configured like this:

.. code-block:: python

    auth_settings = OverhaveAuthorizationSettings(auth_strategy=AuthorizationStrategy.LDAP)
    ldap_manager_settings = OverhaveLdapManagerSettings(ldap_admin_group="admin")

S3 cloud
--------

**Overhave** implements functionality for *s3* cloud interactions, such as
bucket creation and deletion, files uploading, downloading and deletion.
The framework provides an ability to store reports and other files in
the remote s3 cloud storage. You could enrich your environment with following
settings:

.. code-block:: shell

    OVERHAVE_S3_ENABLED=true
    OVERHAVE_S3_URL=https://s3.example.com
    OVERHAVE_S3_ACCESS_KEY=<MY_ACCESS_KEY>
    OVERHAVE_S3_SECRET_KEY=<MY_SECRET_KEY>

Optionally, you could change default settings also:

.. code-block:: shell

    OVERHAVE_S3_VERIFY=false
    OVERHAVE_S3_AUTOCREATE_BUCKETS=true

The framework with enabled ```OVERHAVE_S3_AUTOCREATE_BUCKETS``` flag will create
application buckets in remote storage if buckets don't exist.

API
---
**Overhave** has it's own application programming interface, based on
`FastAPI`_.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TinkoffCreditSystems/overhave/master/docs/includes/images/api_img.png
  :width: 600
  :align: center
  :alt: Allure test-case report

  **Overhave** openapi.json through `Swagger`_

Current possibilities could be displayed through built-in
`Swagger`_ - just run the API and open http://localhost:8000 in your
browser.

.. code-block:: bash

    overhave api -p 8000

Interface has authorization through `oauth2`_ scheme, so you should setup
```OVERHAVE_API_AUTH_SECRET_KEY``` for usage.

Right now, API implements types of resources:

* `feature_tags`
    get feature tag or get list of feature tags;
* `features`
    get features info by tag ID or tag value;
* `test_users`
    get test user info, specification, put new specification or delete
    test user;
* `test_runs`
    get test run info or create test run with given parameters;
* `emulations`
    get emulation runs by test user id.

Contributions are very welcome.

Preparation
-----------

Project installation is very easy
and takes just few prepared commands (`make pre-init` works only for Ubuntu;
so you can install same packages for your OS manually):

.. code-block:: shell

    make pre-init
    make init

Packages management is provided by `Poetry`_.

Check
-----

Tests can be run with `Tox`_. `Docker-compose`_ is used for other services
preparation and serving, such as database. Simple tests and linters execution:

.. code-block:: shell

    make up
    make test
    make lint

Please, see `make` file and discover useful shortcuts. You could run tests
in docker container also:

.. code-block:: shell

    make test-docker

Documentation build
-------------------

Project documentation could be built via `Sphinx`_ and simple `make` command:

.. code-block:: shell

    make build-docs

By default, the documentation will be built using `html` builder into `_build`
directory.
